# Import Snippets

In order to import the snippets to your coc and neovim installations, after the
initial installation of this setup is completed, you need to copy this folder to
the following path

`~/.config/coc/ultisnips/go.snippets`

you can do this with the following command

`mkdir -p ~/.config/coc/ultisnips && cp -r ~/.config/nvim/ultisnips/*.snippets ~/.config/coc/ultisnips`
